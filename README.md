# ETL processes 
The repository contains scripts related to ETL processes to obtain, transform and analyze/visualize data from an online bird data repository. The first folder contains the code to download and transform the ebird data and the second folder contains code to auto-load new data to the original dataset. This is an ongoing project with timely edits.
